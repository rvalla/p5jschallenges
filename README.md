# p5 chanllenges

Sometimes I have to teach something. I use this repository to teach programming with **p5js**. The
comments in the javascript code are in Spanish because I am in Buenos Aires as are my students.  

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

This little project is possible thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**p5js**](https://p5js.org): a wonderful javascript library.
